Exercise 2:

exploit-2a.py, exploit-2b.py 

exploits bug#2 (http.c:159) by passing in a header field
with a very long value

exploit-2b.py 

exploit  bug#5 (http.c:255) by passing in a request path
that's longer than 1024.


Exercise 3:

exploit bug#1. README shows how to do this.

Exercise 4:
expolit Bugs#1 and #2 

Exercise 5:

1  If you submit an HTTP request without a newline character, the read()
call in http_read_line will block, and zookd will not accept any new incoming
connections. This basically results in denial-of-service; the website becomes unusable. . 


 2. There is no auth when transfering zoobars between users, so an attacker may
call the transfer service to change the other users' information or others.
